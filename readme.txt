For this project I created 5 webpages that all link together through the navigation bar links.
I created both a header and a footer that is on all pages. The header is set to the sticky position so that when the user scrolls, the heading 
stays showing. In the header I included the festival name, the dates, and the nav bar that links to the other 4 pages.

On the home page I input a section that told what the event was, along with an image to the right.
I rounded the images border using border-raidus, and gave it a shadow using box-shadow to make it look like its popping off the page.
Under that section I included another picture with the same shadow and rounded borders, and to the right of that image I included a section
giving the user a sneak peak into what's going on at the event. I listed a few events and then created a link in the word "more" that links to 
the event page where all the events are listed, I also changed that word to a red color.
I also created a border line to the left of the first section, and the right of the second section, using border-right and setting the thickness 
to 1px and the color to black. At the bottom I put a "closing statement" for the page and then the footer.
The footer has 3 social media icons, and all 3 icons are linked to their respective website so that when they are clicked on it takes the user 
there. 

On the events page I created a flyer-look by giving the div container a background color and box-shadow. 
On the left side of the flyer, there is the name of the event followed by 3 pictures stacked on each other.
I then created a vertical border to sepereate the 2 sides. On the right side is a list of all the events for the 3 days.
I created this by inputing 3 different tables, one for each day. Each table has the time of the event followed by the title of the event.

On the food page I wanted to go with a flyer/menu look again so I created two div containers, and gave them each the same background color, and 
spaced them how I liked. On the left flyer, I made what would be the front, with a title, a slogan, inserted an image with a transparent background,
and included the dates again at the bottom. I also created horizontal border lines using border-top and border-bottom.
On the right flyer I made the actual menu. I created 4 diferent tables, each within thier own div so that I could place them on top of each other 
and side by side. I used display: inline-block and set a width for all the tables so they lined up how I liked.
I came up with 8 food/drinks options and priced them, with the entres under main course, snacky foods under snacks, sweets under deserts and drinks
under the drink title. 

On the location page I titled it Location, and have a subtitle "venue". Under venue I listed the venue name, 
then the addres, and then inserted text where I linked the word "directions" to google maps. I took a screen shot of the venue in google maps and 
inserted that image to the right, also puting a box-shadow on it.

On the contact us page, I put a section of text to the left, and listed contact info underneath. To the right I created a form. The form has 
a text box for first name, lastst name, email, phone number, and finally the message box. 
When creating the form I didn't use <label> because I liked the look better without it. I used type=number for phone number box and type=email for
the email box to ensure users input the correct information. I also made every box required.
For the submit button I made the bacckground color red, and when you hover over it the cursor, font color, and background color all change.
